Vue Project Notes

* Can hook up Vue to application through script in index.html or through CLI from Vue. (This project is using the script in index.html)

* Create a Vue instance in a js file (app.js for this application)

* Vue instance template:
    const app = Vue.createApp({
        template: ''
        data() {
            return {
                
            },
        },
        methods:{
            
        }
    );

    app.mount("#app");

    - template is a string with base html 
    - app.mount renders the Vue instance to index.html if there is an element with an id of app 
    - to render elements from the data function you need {{ }} which can be used in the template or index.html (as long as it's within the #app container)

* Vue bind things to elements - two ways:
    v-bind:src="" (what's inside "" is the key for something inside the Vue instance)
    :src="" (works the same as above just s shorthand for it)

* Add functions to button - two ways:
    v-on=click="getUser()" (click is the event we are looking for and getUser is a function we create in the methods area of the Vue instance)
